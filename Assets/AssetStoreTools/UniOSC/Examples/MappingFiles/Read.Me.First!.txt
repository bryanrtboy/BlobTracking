The mapping files are serialized with Unity 4.3. 

If you use the mapping files in another version of Unity it is possible that weired problems arise.

You have to do a couple of steps to circumvent obscure behavior and exceptions.

1. Close the UniOSC Editor.

2. Unzip the mapping files folder.

3. Go to  'Edit/Project Settings/Editor'

4. Switch the Asset Serialization Mode to 'Force Text'.

5. Switch back to 'Force Binary'.



Your mapping files should now be OK for the Unity version you use.
